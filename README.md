Coding Dojo Django Fundamentals "Random Word Generator" assignment


Assignment: Random Word Generator
Create a new Django project with a single application. Your template will show a random word of length 14.

The first time you use this app, it should say 'attempt #1'. Each time you generate a new random keyword, it should increment the attempt figure. The purpose of this assignment is to reinforce your understanding of form submissions and session. Don't spend too much time on the random word generator, it's okay if your random word is not a real word.
